                <p>Recommender systems aim to predict usersâ€™ interests and recommend product items that quite likely are
                    interesting for them.</p>
                <p>value of recommendation</p>
                <p>Netflix: 2/3 of movies watched are recommended</p>
                <p>Google news: recommendation generates 38% clickthrough</p>
                <p>Amazon: 35% sales from recommendation</p>
                <p>So, as per the business standpoint, the more relevant products a user finds on the platform, the
                    higher their engagement. it results in increased revenue for the various platform.</p>
                <p>1. Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Systems</p>
                <p>2. Nearest Neighbors (Un-Supervised) Algorithm</p>
                <p>Although, modern recommendation uses the both approaches called as Hybrid recommendation.</p>
                <p>The key idea behind CF is that similar users share the same interest and that similar items are liked
                    by a user. examples of this are found in the recommendation systems of Netflix, and Spotify.</p>

                <!-- <p>Hybrid Engine</p>
                <p>We brought together ideas from content and collaborative filtering to build an engine that gave movie
                    suggestions to a particular user based on the estimated ratings that it had internally calculated
                    for that user.</p>  -->
